        <h2>MOM I AM HURT</h2>

        <P>
            Mom, I did make you proud today <br>
            Only I am hurt, and here is where I lay <br>
            There I was, fighting for our country with such valor <br>
            Honoring the American flag, and its three colors <br>
            <br>
            Mom, I did make you proud today <br>
            Please don't cry when you here what I have to say <br>
            I no longer am whole, as I look to my legs <br>
            I killed so many, my mind is in a fog, and a horrible haze <br>
            <br>
            Mom, I did make you proud today <br>
            I need your prayers, so the doctors say <br>
            My head has a deep gash, my legs are all but gone <br>
            I did my American duty, and they say I went far beyond <br>
            <br>
            Mom, I did make you proud today <br>
            The battle ground was full of bodies, forgive me I pray <br>
            I think I am numb from what I have just gone through <br>
            All of these emotions, as I honored the red, white and blue <br>
            <br>
            Mom, I did make you proud today <br>
            I can no longer walk, as I did yesterday <br>
            Tell the family and all who will listen, that dad would be proud <br>
            As they gather at Arlington, where he lays in the ground <br>
            <br>
            Dad I did make you proud today <br>
            You gave your life to your country in this very same way <br>
            I hold onto your purple heart as the doctors work on me <br>
            Mom and Dad, let us pray for peace from our enemy <br>
            <br>
            Mom and Dad I did make you proud today <br>
            They are holding up an American flag on this day as we all pray <br>
            So now that the world is at peace once again <br>
            I will try to cope, making my wheelchair my friend <br>
