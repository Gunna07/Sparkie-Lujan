        <p>This website was created, and has been dedicated to Shara, my sister who has since passed away from Breast Cancer
        <i>6-19-03.</i> <br> I had the privilege to love her more than words could ever express The Lord blessed me well when he gifted me a
        loving sister like Shara!</p>

            <p>
            Because of the fact that I couldn't make my sister's funeral in So. Cal. I did something else in her honor. <br>
            <br>
            To explain yesterday, it goes like this. I went the night before and bought all of Shara's favorite foods, and cooked
            them. I then got up in the morning, and taped Wind Beneath My Wings, Where Art Thou, I Will Always Love You, Amazing
            Grace, and a few others. I then got dressed into clothes we purchased together when she was here last summer. I had
            found a two-yard piece of fabric, and sewed a tablecloth for this as well. The pattern on the tablecloth was stick girls
            holding hands, and it read all over it, Sister Love. <br>
            <br>
            I then took flowers I found in a field the day before and took them out of the fridge. I then went through family albums
            and took pictures of everyone in there. Her kids, a pic of her and Ronn, my kids, myself, and then relatives that I
            haven't seen in some 20 years, but she had because they are in So. Cal. <br> I then took those pics, and rolled them up like
            a diploma. I then tied that to the flower stems. I packed this picnic lunch, and I drove 3 hours to a spot on the Clark
            Fork River I knew it would carry the flowers easily. I suppose there were closer rivers, but the setting I knew of, was
            so tranquil, private, and beautiful. <br>
            <br>
            I then timed everything out. I left here at 10am, got to the spot at 1pm. Her funeral was set for 2pm my time, 1pm her
            time. I had one hour to set up the music and spread the blanket, and take out the china and crystal. I wanted nothing
            less for this picnic with Shara. I even folded cloth napkins with silverware and tied them closed with a ribbon. I set
            up our places, and served Arbor Mist, Peach, her favorite. Both plates had her favorite foods. <br>
             <br>
            I then sat there, talked to her about all the new things going on in my life, my fears, our history, and fun things. I
            didn't once dwell on Ronn, or the kids. I tended to think she knew that stuff already. <br> At exactly 2pm, when her funeral
            was to begin at 1pm in So. Cal, I toasted her and myself to "sister love" and I told her as I clinked her glass, that I
            would make her proud with what I do with the rest of my life. I told her she could watch over her family, keep them
            safe, and keep them healthy. I let all the bad things such as feelings, and unhappy events this last 7 weeks go with
            that clink. <br>
            <br>
            I then stood up, and when Amazing Grace played, I guess I looked up to the sky and told her it was time to say so long,
            but not good-bye. I told her to spread her wings over heaven and keep herself warm. As Wind Beneath My Wings began to
            play, I took her wine, and the food in her dish, and tossed them into the river. I never want her to be hungry, or crave
            a thing. <br>
            <br>
            When Where For Art Thou came on, I tossed the flowers and the tied pics into the river, and told her to spread her love
            abundantly. At the moment the flowers hit that rushing water, the bow broke, and the flowers, and the pictures spread
            out on the water, coating the surface. I do believe that was her sign that her love would spread forever. <br> I had tied
            them to so tight, but it didn't stay tight once in the water. <br>
            <br>
            I then played I will always love you, as I packed up the remaining items, and I went home. All the way home, it rained.
            It was so sunny during our picnic, and then the rain. I think I matched the flow of rain to tears on this day. <br>
            <br>
            So what I do with the rest of my life, as promised, will be to make her proud of me. I just have to figure out my
            destiny now, and learn how to live alone without my sister, or our calls. I don't know if I can do this, but I want to
            try. <br>
            <br>
            
            Before I left, I decided to leave the tablecloth there, just in case someone needed that spot, for sharing his or her
            heart with another. It was a one-time use tablecloth, for this day of Sharaâ€™s and mine. <br>
            <br>
            
            So on this day, I lay my sister to eternal rest. I would like to think she was there, as they honored her in So. Cal.
            without me.  <br>
            <br>
