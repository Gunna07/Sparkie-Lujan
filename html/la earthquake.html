        <h2>LOS ANGELES EARTHQUAKE</h2>
        <p>
            I am sharing this story in confidentiality, because my nature is to do things without recognition.  With all the media, and interviews, donations this event created, and it had its lime light moment, and I have moved on from it with amazing memories. There is glory in this story, and I gave it all to the Lord. He truly was my hero, my shining star, my heart in action. Keni one of my best friends,  and I now reminisce of this event and giggle, always in disbelief.  She will however roll her eyes abundantly when telling you this story. (Nightmare actually)  I have dragged her into two more community events like this...........those I have yet to share with with anyone, but my olive branch heart and hand remembers. My non profit foundation is one of them, but that too has its own story. LOL, The Alberton, Montana train derailment is another. I just can't help myself, or my hearts craving to help strangers when dramatic and  life changing events occur, leaving people feeling helpless. <br> <br>

            It would appear over the years, my world has at times consisted of an invisible neon sign that has to read: "Hey folks,
            ya gotta need? I am the lady who can help!" Somewhere inside my heart is a beating urgency just waiting to help a
            stranger, and it's constantly beating within my soul! Ya gotta be brave though. I tend to be a fire cracker, as well as
            a shaker and mover when the possibility to turn tears to laughter and joy in someone’s life comes to my attention. <br>
<br>
            If you think back to 1994, Los Angeles had a huge earthquake. It was a Monday if I remember right. It was called the
            Northridge Earthquake.
            <br> <br>

        Earthquake: 20 Years Ago Today</i></a>
           
           
<br>
<br>
I was sitting in my living room with my husband, and the pastor of our church, but truth be known, it was actually just
my pastor and myself. I was entering another silent treatment episode. Three weeks of silent treatments in my marriage
wasn't new, but more my norm. My reality was it was my church, because he never was one to attend with me and the
kiddos. No biggy back then. Moving right along into this LONG story! <br>
<br>

Prior to moving to Montana, I lived in a ski resort in Wrightwood, California, a mountain area on the San Andreas fault.
I was the lady in charge of earthquake preparedness for the school systems and entire districts there. This was another
thing I got involved with as wild hair up my cushie tushie saw a community need, and my hand raised up happily to
develop a secured program to protect the children of this area. <br>
<br>

Working, raising kiddos, and taking on earthquake education and collection for all the kiddos in school district was
daunting, with lifesaving supplies but very needed there. Ya know, another "have to help and give" project that grew
exponentially, and I had great support from the fire department, churches, so many school administrators, and more. My
biggest supporter of this project first was from the Lord, then the community. I am so blessed with many stories like
this in my life. My olive branch personality is always at the forefront of my existence. We had only moved to Montana
months before after my husband retired from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department. <br>
<br>

The TV was on in the other room, and among my conversation with the Pastor I heard "we have an urgent news bulletin." So
while talking to the pastor about his sermon the previous day, and awaiting dinner to be served, I had one ear on the
pastor, and one trying to hear the bulletin. Immediately when they said earthquake, Los Angeles, I excused myself to
listen to the bulletin. It was horrible news, and I was so far away from Southern California, where I grew up . Without
hesitation, I knew this was an event that I couldn't ignore and my heart had to try to make a difference, for others in
need. <br>
<br>

I went back into the living room, and told the pastor "I have to do something!" He said, "Sparkie, you do whatever you
need to do, its your calling, and we are well aware of your ability to help others, so you go girl!" Past conversations
had exposed my community project addictions. I was taken back by his remarks because he really didn't know me all that
well, just my cooking I guess. *rolling eyes!” My mind was already in "motion" and "organizing" what had to be done.
It's just how I work when on a mission I suppose. <br>
<br>

I reached out for the local phone book and began calling all the stores in Missoula that carried trash cans. Large ones.
Why I did this immediately, I have no idea. I think in total I bought about 30 extra large trash cans. I then called
local stores and asked permission to place "Los Angeles Earthquake Relief Donations" cans in their stores. Every store
said yes. Some stores donated more trash cans and I provided the signs for the cans. My mind and heart was in high gear,
seriously aimlessly taking actions without any direction or past guidance. <br>
<br>

I placed a call to Dennis Washington, the owner of Montana Rail Link (trains that carry coal and goods from Montana) and
asked if he would make a donation to this endeavor. I had known him because at that time when the earthquake happen, my
employer was at a dental company where I was part of the administration division. I had set up lunch dates with Mr.
Washington and my boss, several times as well as myself for critical business tax law changes and brain storming
protocols. <br>
<br>

Implementing them was resting on my shoulders. Dennis sent a Currier over with a check for $500.00. Little did I know,
he had heard of my "cause," and didn't tell me that. His generous heart and that check was only the beginning of the
miracles yet to happen. I thought WOW, that's wonderful, and thanked him profusely later when the nightmare was over. <br>
<br>

Next I called the newspapers, both in Missoula, and then in all the major cities newspapers in Montana. I told them my
name, and asked permission to put cans in their towns. Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing, but was on auto pilot
to get these victims help. I then asked the pastor to give me a list of churches we affiliated with, and he made a call
and provided it to me. The next day I had the list. I called those in charge of the "phone tree" at each church.
Everyone I talked to said they would spread the word, and give them my phone number. Oh Lord, what was I
thinking???!!!!! <br>
<br>

I set up an in person interview with newspaper reporters and told them I was going to get as many donations as possible
to those victims. I didn't have any game plan since I seriously doubted I could make a difference. I was positive they thought I was a lunatic. The next day, that interview aired in
Montana. My phone went nuts, the donations were coming in. Trash cans were filling up, and pick up trucks from my church
were getting full cans, and replacing them with empty one, and bringing the full ones to my house. My three car garage
was being used to store things. Heck, I thought a three car garage was more than ample. NOT, NOT, NOT! *cracking up* I
needed a three story warehouse type building, with a basement, an attic, and several room additions, and certainly more
than the five acres I resided on. Before all was said and done, the horse coral was also involved. ROFLMAO We are
talking donations here! <br>
<br>

So, the church phone trees started, touching the quilting guilds, the church members, their families, their friends,
cousins, you name it baby, and more. Montana folks were watching TV's obviously when they all should of been out hiking,
fishing, and partying down. That interview lasted through two days, and every TV station in Montana had it on a loop,
and was playing it four or more times a day. Heck, what was I thinking? What were they thinking?? LOL <br>
<br>

WELL.........I guess I really pissed off the Red Cross big time!!! They in turn called the TV stations, and did their
OWN interview on MY interview. That was the wrong thing to do. ( I didn't know that at the time.) The Red Cross called
me "a woman who didn't have the education to handle this type of disaster, nor understood the magnitude of the need.”
They said, "DON'T LISTEN TO HER, SHE CAN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!!" Send US your donation of dollars and we will take over
from here!" Man oh man, that set Montana's folks on a war path. Montana folks were/are fighters for the underdog for
sure!! I believe my canine teeth bit a little to deeply on the Red Cross toes, but with success in my endeavor, failure
was possible. <br>
<br>

My phone never stopped ringing. Day and night. This is when I called Keni, my friend to help. Maybe the Red Cross was
right, but I wasn't going to be intimidated by them. I called the TV stations again, and challenged Montana to be heard
in all counties, cities, and towns. Holy Toledo what was I thinkin??? Well, whatever it was, the Lord again was my
driver. <br>
<br>

My pastor called and said a church member was heading down to his daughters home in So. Calif, and his pick-up truck bed
was going to be empty. He told me I could put the few donations in that truck. I then invited the pastor over to see if
these donations would fit in the back of that pick-up truck, knowing full well the head shaking this pastor was going to
encounter. I was so excited about his arrival in coming over to see the volume already donated! <br>
<br>

He drove up the long driveway. I was fully aware that he was thinking a few bags of donations easily could fit in his
church members truck bed. This was on day one, after the interview, and he had a head shaking, hand on hips, eye rolling
moment for sure. LOL He asked me, "how are you ever going to get this stuff down there?" I remember that sickening
feeling in my tummy when I told him, "now pastor, are you doubting the driver in my life?" He didn't respond. So I
continued, "As a child of the Lord pastor, I don't doubt that answer will come, but for now, what's important is getting
the donations here. Getting them delivered was the miracle yet to be understood." He gazed at me as if I was a lunatic.
ROFLMAO He then said, "well, okay then, lets see how this all plays out." So much for HIS faith in the Lord, I guess.
Mine was teetering, but I wasn't going to show him that uncertainty in me! <br>
Thinking quietly in my own mind was how the heck was I going to get all this stuff down there??? I hadn't a clue, but I had faith, and that's all anyone needs.
<br>
<br>
The following day I was gifted with 6000 gallons of water in jugs donated, from a private water company that was
privately owned in Montana. Now imagine, a drinking water bottling company the number one water company challenging all
their competitors to match this 6000 gallon of water donation for "Sparkies Cause". This was a nick name that became a
household name I guess overnight. I didn't plant that seed, but it got rooted nevertheless. <br>
<br>

They were sending "huge trucks" to my home and unloading them jug after jug. I had received so much water up the ying
yang!! The quilting guilds sent out their challenges, and were driving from all over the state to my home and dropping
off handmade quilts. Truck after truck pulled up my driveway, (we are talking two days after my interview) and the trash
cans couldn't be emptied fast enough, and replaced. Food donations were coming in by the truck load, shoes, clothing,
toys, games, tents, lanterns, and more. You name it, and my garage was PLUMB FULL, and so was my huge home. There was
stuff everywhere. Needless to say my husband was furious with me. I knew he wouldn't lift a finger, nor say an approving
word, but his looks and silence was abundant. My heart was hurting with his behavior while part of my heart was joyful
in my actions. I had to keep helping others, because it was addiction. <br>
<br>

Keni and I enlisted "helpers" from the school football team, to the Boy Scouts, church members, and everyone was willing
to help. Banners were being hung on my house that I DIDN'T make. Banners on the garage, corals, mailboxes and directions
banners to Sparkie house appeared everywhere. "Sparkies Cause" for Los Angeles, this way. IT WAS NUTS! ROFLMAO Through
all the joyous moments, I knew my silent treatment days were going to be extended indefinitely. It really didn't matter,
I just kept thinking, “at the end of this project” maybe a word of approval would be shared with me by my husband. That
wasn't a destiny to be experienced. It was weeks upon weeks the silence continued. The looks were daggers to my heart
because he just didn't have the capacity for empathy or sympathy no matter who you were. This was my norm in my marriage
and part of me wanted to head to Los Angeles for good, but my marriage vows cemented me where I would remain for the
rest of my life. This was also my reality. <br>
<br>
The phone kept ringing, and ringing, donations and more donations. It was to me amazing.
</p>
<h4> <i>THE MIRACLES</i></h4>
<p>
RING RING went the phone. It was NEW YORK calling. They wanted to let me know a truck with donations were on their way
to Montana. Figures someone in Montana had relatives in NY!!! <br>
<br>
Well, that was really something, but only <i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #1.</i>  <br>
The miracles kept coming. <br>
<br>
<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #2</i> . Barnum and Baily Circus, yes THAT ONE called. They were donating their BIGGEST circus tent to "Sparkies Cause" and it
was going to be delivered directly to So. Calif for the donations to be distributed from. Seriously???? A Circus Tent??
OMG they must have known my life this point was a circus!!! <br>
<br>

<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #3</i> Evidently the FVW in Montana was doing their own challenges from all their "club members" without me knowing
it till the very end. Then I got the call. This is your local VFW president, and we would like to let you know that our
sister club in So Calif has activated over 100 members to receive these donations if you need help with your collection.
How is that going by the way?" I remember glancing around my house, and looking out to the garage and the horse coral,
and the rest of the acres, and I told him, "I think we might be able to use your members in distributing these
donations." (Tongue in cheek) HECK YEAH, we need help! I needed a shrink at this point. Honestly I could only think of
loading up my tee top Camaro with the top down, and making several hundred trips to So Calif. ROFLMAO <br>
<br>

<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #4</i> Ring Ring, "hi again, this is NY calling". Again??? Ok, what now? Well. Mr. Washington of Missoula Montana,
the owner of Montana Rail Link has agreed that we could use HIS rail system to bring this train car filled to the brim
to your location to bring you more donations!!! A train car?? From New York??? Filled to the brim??? To MY house?? Are
you kidding me???? Of course, why not?? Keni about fainted right there, right then!!! I was certain she would abandon
ship. She didn't!!! "Sure, no problem, and thank you so much" I told him. (thank you so much??? are you kidding Sparkie
I said to myself) Ok, a few thousand trips in my top down Camaro could do this.......with a few oil changes, and tires.
What the heck, I had Dennis Washington's $500.00 for this endeavor, right?? *rolling eyes* <br>
<br>

<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #5</i> A man in a very small town here in Summers Montana called. Why not, everyone else was calling. "Hello, is
this Sparkie the lady with a cause?" I really wanted to say, nope ya got the wrong number, but instead I gulped, and
said, "yes sir, it is!" "Oh good, this is Frank, and I am a long haul driver, from Summers, Montana, and I want to
donate the gas for my truck, and me and the wife want to load up my truck with the donations, and bring them to So.
Calif. We just feel the Lord told us to get involved." WOW.........."I would be honored to accept your help, and yes
your truck will be fully loaded with donations." (now this would ease up a few trip in the Camaro for sure) Summers,
Montana??? Where the heck is that? No clue! <br>
<br>

<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #6</i> Oh man, ..........ring ring. 'Hello, is this Ms. Sparkie of the LA Cause?" While standing during this phone
call I was thinking, "Doesn't anybody work, or sleep on earth since that damn earthquake???" "Yes, it is Sparkie." Gosh
I began hating my name, hating my phone, as he continues. "Well Ms. Sparkie, I have about 1k pair of shoes to bring to
your location. We challenged shoe stores, one in which I own, to donate to your cause! Now what is your address please?"
WHAT???????????? SAY WHAT??????????? Yep, <i>miracle #6</i> was a walking nightmare! Or running nightmare! You choose your
weapon of choice with this donation!! Shoes.....I think shoes easily could be used by these earthquake victims. They
were delivered. Amazing to see that many pairs of shoes lining the outside parameter of my home. <br>
<br>

Trucks were now coming up my driveway with BANNERS plastered on their sides with "LA Earthquake donations being
delivered to "Sparkies Cause" It was unreal to say the least. Ok, ONE last TV Interview to say Thank You, and enough is
enough LOL.......... "I think we have enough donations, so please know how grateful everyone whose heart you have
touched will be helped! If you will indulge me with one more request, the challenge now is getting these donations to So Calif to the victims. I
told them I was willing to drive as many trips in my Camaro as needed to get the donations there but I think any help in
this situation would be grately appreciated. WELL, they must have thought I was serious, because MA BELL out did herself
the next day. <br>
<br>
<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #7</i>  Ring ring, YES it is Sparkie...........uh huh, yes, uh huh!! So let me get this straight sir. "You own Town Pump gas
stations, and you are donating ALL the gas I need, all the tires I need for the Camaro to haul these donations to Los
Angeles??" YEP............but but but.........ok, I have a map, a cooler, and I knew I could do this. <br>
Well remember that trucker that called, the one with the wife in Summers, Montana??? Well by golly, he did his own over
the trucker CB radio "Sparkie challenge", and we now had three semi's willing to haul loads. Things were looking up!! <br>
<br>

<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #8</i> Ring ring, Yes sir, I remember you. You own Town Pump gas stations. You talked to an over the road truck driver,
yes.......and ..........you are donating ALL their gas to haul the donations? uh huh.........and tires too?? So, let me
get this straight.........I don't have to drive my Camaro to So Calif? WOW.......three semi's, their gas, their tires if
needed. Donated. Ok, things were really looking up!!! <br>
I could use that $500.00 for food for the drivers...........NOT.......as the Lord would say!!! <br>
<br>
<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #9</i> Ring ring, "Yes, hello Mr. Washington!" You are donating as many rail cars needed to carry the NY rail cars load, and
the balance of the donations in your train cars after the semi's are loaded all the way to Los Angeles??? That sounds
Fantastic!! I can manage to feed the truckers, and the train engine driver and the caboose man too. Things are really
looking up! <br>
<br>
<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #10</i> Ring ring........Yes sir I have heard of the Flying J gas stations. You want to donate all the gas to the truck
drivers, and showers if needed, and food as they travel down to So Calif??? Well sir, that would be wonderful. So you
heard about this from chatter on truck drivers CB's huh? Yes, Town Pump has also made a gas donation. Sure, you can call
the owner and work out splitting the gas situation. I am grateful for your offer to call him, and do this. Ok, a gas war
is on. ROFLMAO. <br>
Overnight, gas vouchers arrived at the house. Obviously these two gentleman talked and worked out an arrangement. Thank
you Lord! <br>
<br>

<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #11</i> Ring ring...........there was no texting back then, Praise the Lord for that!!! "Hello............yes.........VFW
........I have talked to a gentleman from there. OH so you are the big honcho in So. Calif huh? *listening intently*
Yes, I understand Barnum and Baily Circus was delivering a tent for the donation distribution area. (I hadn't secured a
location yet.......but I had some in mind with the connections I had down there. It was on my list of things to get
done, mind you) Well, you have the donation area already to receive these donations? Yes sir...........and the tent is
already set up? Yes sir, and your 100 workers is now over 200 workers? Yes sir.........well thank you sir, I will let
you know when the semi's leave Montana as well as the trains! Trains??? Really?? Yep, really! <br>
<br>

<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #12</i> The local football teams, boy scout, church kids, my kiddos, adults and Keni and myself were organizing the donations,
and of course..........ring ring......Yes, I understand you are the district manager of the Days Inn Hotels. Uh huh,
yes, wow, you are donating all the hotel rooms needed for all the drivers??? Well thank you, that is so generous of your
hotels. I will pass that information on. Thank you again!!! <br> Looking at my list, we have gas, we have trucks, we have trains, we have food, showers, hotel rooms, tires if needed,
drivers, VFW workers, circus tent, and on and on. <br>
Ring ring............”hello......yes pastor, sure...........see you in a bit”. I just started to cry hysterically. I am
not sure if it was from exhaustion, elation, prayers answered, or what, but soon I was on my knees with an amazing sense
of humbleness to the Lord and his gifts to this child of his. Waterfalls of tears streaming down my face, and feeling so
humble, so awestruck in this moment. <br>
The pastor walked over and told me, "Sparkie, this was a wonderful idea, but maybe we need to call the Red Cross, and
ask for help." I handed him my list of items donated, and he stood there speechless. I got enough composure to tell him
"the Lord drove this bus pastor, this is his doing." He gave me look of disbelief at my depth of faith, followed by a
crushing hug. It was I believe this hugging moment, an exchange of friendship, and mutual admiration in our beliefs that
there is a higher power that produces miracles. <br>
The Red Cross said one lady can't make a difference. They were right, I couldn't. But what they should have said is this
ladies faith in the Lord will surpass anything the Red Cross could accomplish in a lifetime by one of their members!!!
What was donated in one week, helped hundreds of families, hundreds of children, and clothed and shoes for so many
people. <br>
<br>

<i style="color: goldenrod;">Miracle #13</i>  Ring ring........Yes this is Sparkie. The VFW chapters in the greater Los Angeles area wanted to put on a Sparkie
thank you dinner, and wanted to know what date would work best for me. I declined his offer, and asked that those that
could donate to their church of choice, or children's charity of choice would feed my heart better than any benefit
dinner. The benefactor in this was the Lord, and he so kindly accepted my request and understood my denial of such a dinner. <br>
The circus tent was erected, the trucks and trains were unloaded, the donations were delivered. At the end of this
ordeal, VFW called again and asked what should be done with the circus tent??? Easily answered. I asked that they call
and donate it to the headquarters of Boy Scouts of America for their Jamborees when they are held. I knew of these
Jamborees because my oldest son and I took years in involvement from Indian Braves to his Eagle Scout badge and his
attendance at the jamborees. This tent as far as I know is used for these events even today when the jamborees are held. <br> Almost every city in Montana made donations, every town, every quilting guild, water companies privately owned, shoe
stores, and so many families gave and gave to those in need in So.Calif. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This whole situation from beginning to end, for me was indeed living through the Lords miracles. It humbled me to my
knees, it filled my heart, it was knowing that my faith can not only set me free of the challenges in my life, but it
can bring you amazing fulfillment and so many giving hearts to your very own doorstep, when a need is known. How blessed
I have been with the Lord driving my life. <br>
<br>

By the way..........the following week, the Red Cross did one more interview. A retraction of their words. They
apologized through TV, Radio, and Newspapers saying they were wrong about me. "There is a lady in Montana who could and
did make a difference in the LA Earthquake Disaster." <br>
<br>

The pastor always looked at me differently when I sat in his pews after this week long journey I took in helping. It was
a look I am not sure I can describe except to say that his eyes and heart were able to be reaffirmed that the Lord works
in mysterious way. For that week, it was indeed a miracle of mysterious blessings to us all who are his children of
faith. <br>
<br>

When a train derailment occurred here in Alberton, Montana, oddly enough the Red Cross called me, and asked if and how
they could help ME with this disaster. One interview, was all I committed to when this happen. I assured them I would
call them if and when their help was needed. Praise the Lord, he again was the driver, and he allowed me to push the gas
pedal in that situation. I never had to call them back asking for help, and that was just how it was. I would however
call them instantly and without reservation if in fact the task was requiring another driver. I will share this train
thingy one day with you. <br>
<br>

My faith in God is in his hands, as is my heart, and he will always be my driver. He is my constant, and my balance when
life is challenging, as well as tranquil. I want to
thank you for allowing me to share this with you. Its been
locked away in my heart and computer for years and years. I am by far, NOT a bible thumper kinda lady. Give me a river,
a stream, pond, creek, lake or a full of bubble bath tub, and they are all easily my conversational space to converse
with my higher power. Praise The Lord!!!
