        <h2>Winter Around Me</h2>
        <p>
            At looking today, out my window <br>
            I see creations, I have never known <br>
            Upon the dusting of the snow <br>
            I feel the warmth of your gentle touch <br>
            <br>
            
            Your eyes show me, of your tender manner <br>
            Thy hands are cracked from the wood you've stored <br>
            This winter is upon the earth <br>
            Within my dwelling it is warm <br>
            <br>
            
            You stand behind me, with your warm breath <br>
            With this presence, I am feeling safe <br>
            It won't matter, how big this storm <br>
            You've built for me this secure place <br>
            <br>
            
            As I live within nails an lumber <br>
            It shelters me from mother nature <br>
            And as I look out my window today <br>
            With you, my love, I am encased. <br>
            <br>
