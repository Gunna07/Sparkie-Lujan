        <h2>How Can We Let The Children Cry</h2>
        <p>
            How can we let the children of the world cry ? <br>
            Sitting in our snuggled warm beds, with a dry eye <br>
            Letting so many children go hungry each full day <br>
            Filling their small tummies, is what I pray <br>
            <br>
            Never hearing their screams of pain, as the night gets darker <br>
            How come us humans, keep missing the marker <br>
            Getting food to the children so they can survive <br>
            If we keep missing the marker, thousands will die <br>
            <br>
            Life is for living the best possible way <br>
            How can we let the children starve in hunger each day <br>
            Give to the children, a small part of your means <br>
            Creating in us a world full of peace and lovely things <br>
            <br>
            Don't let the children's tummies feel the hunger pain <br>
            Think how much all of our futures can gain <br>
            Please give of yourself to the children today and you will find <br>
            Happiness in your heart, and great peace of mind!! <br>
            <br>
