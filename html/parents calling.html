        <h2>THE PARENTS CALLING OF A CHILD</h2>
        <p>
            Where is my child that I gave birth to <br>
            She now flies with God, and the angels too <br>
            I miss her smile at the break of dawn <br>
            Her tangled long hair, her soft stretching yawn <br>
            <br>
            Her calling out daddy on dark stormy nights <br>
            My visions of us playing in the park as we use to fly kites <br>
            Lace in her dress, and her pigtails all curly <br>
            Dancing about the morning hours so early <br>
            <br>
            How could our baby, be gone so soon <br>
            She was just here yesterday, as the clock struck noon <br>
            Didn't that man know, that drinking can kill <br>
            This feeling inside is making me ill <br>
            <br>
            What is the sense in all of this pain <br>
            Show me the lesson that parents of dead children can gain <br>
            The laws of the road, seem to have no foundation <br>
            Now as my child rests, in Gods holy creation <br>
            <br>
            The man who was drinking had no regard for her life <br>
            He himself has left behind three children and a wife <br>
            Wonder if he knew that three drinks were to many <br>
            When in reality drinking and driving with one, is more than plenty <br> <br>
            
            So many lives will suffer due to his lack of regard <br>
            Burning pain inside with flames that can only cause char <br>
            Emotions of anger and rage are now housed in me <br>
            Please follow the rules of the land, as they can saves lives you see! <br>
