        <h2>Trust In Thee</h2>
        <p>
            When my fears were laid before me as my sister passed <br>
        I looked to the heavens as a last resort <br>
        When my fears were laid before me <br>
        I felt as though my life should be abort <br>
        <br>
        Then one day I looked to the heavens again <br>
        And low and behold, I found a friend <br>
        He told me believe in faith, and certainly prayer <br>
        I didn't say a word, I stood there and glared <br>
        <br>
        He continue to say, my sins were a wash <br>
        I asked, "All of them, oh my gosh" <br>
        He was convincing in his promise to me <br>
        I found myself kneeling, praying before thee <br>
        <br>
        He blessed my head, and gave me hope <br>
        I soon felt the noose loosen, on life's rope <br>
        Never give in to despair, nor to your fears <br>
        For it is I, who now knows the Lords love, and life's fears <br>
        <br>
        It is "HE" who now holds my sisters spirit in his care! <br>
