        <h2>MY TOWN</h2>
        <p>
            Funny how life's made us all so greedy This is my town, stop, take time to look around <br>
            It's got buildings with colors, and trees growing from the ground <br>
            The towns people carry smiles on their faces <br>
            Rushing about, at their personal paces <br>
            <br>
            
            There are times, when you see the folks who are rushing about <br>
            This ol' town has a doctor who treats plenty of gout <br>
            Dentists caring for teeth, on children that need it <br>
            Telling the elderly, their gums have receded <br>
            <br>
            
            The schools putting on plays for all to enjoy <br>
            Jails are empty because of the laws we employ <br>
            Homemade pies fill the air with their scent <br>
            You don't have to worry about locks, <br>
            or perhaps where things went <br>
            <br>
            
            This town is a dream and not life's reality <br>
            The real world holds men in jails and in the galleys <br>
            But in this town, there are no hungry or needy <br>
            <br>
            
            Take the time, and visit my town <br>
            Go home again and make changes abound <br>
            Keeping our towns safe and free from harm <br>
            Making it have that old country time charm <br>
            <br>
            
            Do this act for our children to see <br>
            Show them life's wonders this I do plea <br>
            Make them proud of where they grew up <br>
            Show them the glory in life's champion gold cup <br>
            <br>
            
            Lets leave the kids with smiles and wonders <br>
            Making sure we show them our life's blunders <br>
            Give them the education so that they may prosper <br>
            With this ability, they can to...hold out their hand in offers <br>
            <br>
            
            This town that I show you, is a dream in my mine <br>
            Everyone caring, and loving, and wishing to find <br>
            Peace in their hearts, and love in their words and their jokin <br>
            This is what life should be my friend....no crime existing, <br>
            only gentle lovin and strokin <br>
            <br>
