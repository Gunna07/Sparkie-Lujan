        <h2>Children's Inspection</h2>
        <p>
            Cherry trees blooming in the hot summer days <br>
            Low laying clouds, fog, and man made haze <br>
            How can we breath into our lungs, air with drippings of dirt <br>
            The companies doing this, sit, smile, and smirk <br>
            <br>
            Our children, have futures at stake, as we once did <br>
            How can they expect us not to clean up the grit <br>
            Rules, and regulations, and voting on unheard issues <br>
            As the children breath, cough, and cry...as they hold tissues <br>
            <br>
            It is time, to take a stance and make a commitment this day <br>
            Stand together, clean up the earth, and salvage what we made <br>
            Make this earth safe for our children to rejoice in <br>
            Once this is accomplished, all humanity will win <br>
            <br>
            Breathing clean air, is not a God given right <br>
            What it is, is something we have to have in our eye sight <br>
            So pull together, and work in the same direction <br>
            Making clean air our priority, for our children's inspection <br>
            <br>
