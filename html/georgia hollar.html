        <h2>GEORGIA HOLLER</h2>
        <h5>PREFACE</h5>
        <P>
<i>December-2004</i> <br>
<br>

Five years have passed since this event took place, but in my mind and heart, three hundred and sixty five days times
three years is not nearly far enough in the past for any type of memory loss or an inkling of blurriness of the reality
that I lived through. <br>
<br>
This is my story. It is being written as a gift from one best friend to another. Although Kathleen is dead, I do know
she would be grateful to have this accounting of her life written for others to read. Kathleen was a writer. We often
shared our writings and analyzed one another’s stories. It is solely due to the nudges of my dearest friends Alma Curry,
and Mike Waller, and their continued loving urging that this story written. <br>
<br>
I am regurgitating this story of Kathleen’s last days, which was in the end, “hell beyond friendship”. My commitment to
all of these friends gives me the courage to recount, relive, and revisit the Georgia Holler hell zone. <br>
<br>
<i>December-2004</i> <br>
<br>
Christmas is just around the corner. The heaviness in the air is fully suffocating with two ash filled urns, his and
hers, along with one oblong white box with a casket containing a baby girl, eighteen months old. In addition to these
bodies, you also have one fifty something year old woman named Kathleen in a hospital bed dying of stomach Cancer. A
newly found daughter, whom Kathleen adopted out at birth at the age of 47, had been located. The reunification of this
splintered family took place less than a year before. Kathleen was ecstatic and so excited to get to know her daughter. <br>
<br>
In the middle of this life altering holiday season, I am the only healthy one present in this small six hundred fifty
square foot log cabin, somewhere in the Georgia Holler. Sitting squarely in front and amongst the dead, and the dying,
my conscious thoughts are in Montana, where I live. <br>
<br>
I am shell shocked and numb to the core at what my eyes have seen, and my ears have heard. This crushing education my
heart is being forced to learn, along with each inhale and exhale, feels like a slow strangulation of life as it ticks
by moment by moment. Oh my God, I am terrified. Exhaustion rips at my human existence. My naiveté is obliterated. Tears
stream flawlessly like a river that flows out of control in springtime. <br>
This is not feeling like Christmas, but more of a crucifixion of my life, as it is chiseled away with each passing
sixty-second interval, in the Georgia Holler. <br>
<br>
<i>September-2004</i>  <br>
<br>

The phone rings normally as it has almost consistently for the last ten years on a sunny
September morning, in Montana. The familiar voice on the other end of the phone is Kathleen. She is one of my best
friends. We laugh, and giggle, and share stories of the past weeks event. Everything seems normal. Even so normal that
she continues to ask me about home remedies for her chronic tummy aches. On a visit to my home a few years prior,
Kathleen and I discussed her distended tummy. She pushed, and prodded her tummy area, asking me if I thought she looked
fat. I told her no, but then most of the pictures of Kathleen that I had seen over the years were from the shoulders up.
Rarely was there any full-length pictures shared. <br> A few of the pictures I had seen over the years were her standing by
her horse, and her hat in her waist area, or a very baggy shawl covering up her frontal view. I had nothing to gauge her
physique against, other than pictures shared over the Internet email exchanges. <br>
<br>

Oh, Kathleen loved floppy hats, shawls, and most of all her broomstick skirts, and droopy leather boots. She was indeed
the classic Hillbilly from Georgia. Meeting Kathleen for the first time was to say the least an adventure. The
self-proclaimed writer that she believed she was appeared to be as diverse and unique as many of the stories and poems
she shared with me over the years. You would have to love Kathleen for her warm caring heart, her intense love of
animals, as well as the crazy names she labeled them. Every animal had a specific gesture, an antic, a sound that made
it unique in its own rite. Kathleen could depict them all to you in a whirlwind explosion of conversation. She rarely
took a breath during this menagerie sharing compilations of her animal family. Her laughter would be present as her
voice emulated joys while it spilled out in up and down tones. Indeed Kathleen was a very proud mama of her animal
brood. <br>
<br>

These conversations were the same in person, and on the phone. During the visitation with Kathleen to my home, we were
waiting for Alma Curry to arrive from Missouri. Alma, Kathleen and I were part of the foundation board of directors. We
had all become very close friends, When Kathleen decided to make her journey to Montana, I asked Alma to join us. Alma
lives in Missouri, and this was a huge decision for her to fly. Like me, the fear of flying generally overrules any
thoughts of all the fun you are going to have once you arrive at the intended destination. It had been years of
invitations and multiple denials, for Alma to agree, and come to my home for a visit while Kathleen was also visiting,
until now. <br>
<br>

Kathleen was to arrive a few days before Alma. While waiting for Alma’s arrival, Kathleen and I had gone to town three
days in a row, and enjoyed a movie, luncheons, and shopping. I also had taken her for a grand tour of the university
here. Kathleen’s father, who had passed away years prior, was a scientist. Kathleen’s mother was a professor, at a university in Georgia. Both parents had been highly educated people. Their love of learning was
certainly passed on to Kathleen because of the vast educational accomplishments of Kathleen herself. <br> 
Over the years, we did not talk about her parents enough for me to get a clear understanding of her childhood dynamics.
Mostly she would talk about her trust fund set up by them, and its access difficulties. She at times would share how she
always felt as though she had to prove to her uncle, the executor of the trust, that she was indeed disabled, and
medically challenged. <br> When she asked him for funding to acquire medical equipment, or to make a remodeling adjustment to
her very small cabin, he would want diagrams, written explanations, doctor’s prescriptions, and more. Kathleen would
have anxiety attacks, and panic attacks on the phone with me weeks prior to asking her uncle for funding. We are not
talking about a small trust here either. It was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Trust funds that were remaining
after Kathleen’s death were to be relinquished to the university where her mother was a professor for years. <br> During our
friendship, Kathleen had requested several things from her uncle, the trustee and executor of her parents will. Among
these things were walkers, wheelchair, electric scooter, and handicap van. Other requests were for material for George
to complete an enclosed porch for the dogs, as well as Kathleen’s scooter, walker, and other handicap essentials. <br>
<br>
When talking on the phone with Kathleen you would not know, she had long stringy hair that was rarely brush nor washed,
her clothing always worn with some tatter, and of course braless. She laughed at anyone wearing a bra. She would
emphatically and resoundingly say, anyone willing to wear a bra, had to be a lover of incarceration! She prided herself
in being the first braless rebel of her time. <br>
<br>
If you listened carefully to Kathleen speak, you could slightly hear her lisp through words as her gums met one another.
She hated her dentures, even with several attempts to refit them. Kathleen had a complexion of an angel. Soft flowing
cheeks that had little marble like appearance were rosy, and charming. One never would have thought her hands displayed
fingernails so darkly yellowed from the cigarettes she smoked, nor the smell of alcohol she consumed abundantly.
Kathleen whiffed into the air a massive explosion of alcohol fumes as she spoke, in person. <br>
<br>
Kathleen’s infectious laugh kept your ear close to the phone receiver as she reemphasized some antic one of her many
dogs had displayed just hours ago. Everything about Kathleen was whimsical right down to her belief that life was for
enjoying, no matter what society labeled her bizarre lifestyle. Our friendship was as close as sisters could attain, but
we were as different as night and day. <br>
<br>
The only part of our childhood that we both could relate to was the fact we both had childhood Polio. We had both
recovered, became educated, worked for years and years only to be destined disabled in our forties. It was through the
Internet that we met. It was through a miracle of life, we bonded so closely. A miracle of modern technology. <br>
<br>
Saturday was our day to call one another. Usually she would call first as her time zone was later than mine. Like some
things in life that become habit, so did this ritual of calling every Saturday to “check in, check up, check out” life
and the new sites on the Internet we had both discovered during the week. It became as though Saturday was not Saturday
unless we fulfilled this right of passage phone call, so that we could experience Sunday. If we did not call on
Saturday, you might as well of considered life’s hex upon you for the balance of the following week. Nothing seems to
flow, and certainly, nothing unfolded with any semblance of normalcy on Sunday. It was just part of our lives. It is
that simple. Well, it was that simple until life again flipped direction. <br>
<br>

Kathleen and I talked about my traveling to Georgia so many times, and yet I never picked up in her voice the
desperation of how urgent it was for this visit to take place, until now. This time, Kathleen begged me to come to her
home. Chills run through my body and the hairs on the back of my neck tingle every time I recount this one particular
phone call. <br>
<br>

“Sparkie, oh my God Sparkie, I need you. I am dying. I am dying. I can’t believe I am dying. Oh my God Sparkie, I am
terrified. I hurt so badly. I would take this pain for the rest of my life, but I don’t want to die. Oh God Sparkie,
come here, help me, hold me, don’t let me die. I have Stomach Cancer, and I am terrified.” For what seemed an eternity,
her cries of despair rang into my heart, and ears. My heart began racing at a mock pace. I was standing still, and could
feel my body react. Warm wet flowing tears streaming down my cheeks. My heart continues to speed up, and I began to
shiver uncontrollably. My hand was tingling, and soon numb at the tension I must have been holding the phone receiver
with. <br> “Sparkie, help me, please, you are the only one who can help me. I need you, please dear God I need you to be here
right now. Can you come today? Please, just get here, I don’t want to die alone, and I don’t want to do chemotherapy
without you right here by my side. They are telling me there isn’t much hope. I don’t have much time to live they say,
but if you come, we can prove them wrong. I just know we can. Sparkie, help me not to die. I am so afraid, I am so
afraid.” <br>
<br>
<i>This call will be forever seared into my mind, heart and memory for as long as I live.</i> <br>
<br>
The rambling on of Kathleen’s voice depicting in detail her doctors’ visit and his diagnosis were of primal crying out.
Kathleen was trying to be so methodical in a high pitch screaming like manner that made the small hairs in my ear canal
shrivel up and want to find safe haven. The orifices that held my nasal hairs, as well as the socket that kept my eyes
securely in my head were as wide as my mouth as my jaw dropped open to its full capacity. My heart was pounding in such
fear, shock, and disbelief, I was certain I was having a heart attack. I knew the major panic attack I was experiencing
was elevating into the heart attack zone. Little hairs on my arms stood erect. My clothing felt as though it was
shrinking and suffocating the girth area of my body. <br>
<br>
If ones blood could really turn cold by news that shatters within you everything that you have known to be cohesive and
reliable up to a particular moment, my core temperature would have now formed icicles that dangled from every major
organ. My usual anticipation of laughter and giggles, coupled with tears of joy streaming down my face on this
particular Saturday had been replaced with tears of sadness, and despair. <br>
My core temperature was of icicles. My tongue was frozen, and the usual bodily antics of hysterical proportions that
were so familiar with our phone calls, were now emotions of disbelief, anger, rage and overwhelming helplessness. My ear
was being smothered to death as I pushed the receiver harder and harder into my head as though this was going to make me
physically closer to my dear friend. I so desperately wanted her to stop sharing this diagnosis, this death sentence,
and the changing of what we knew to be so normal, such a complete and loving friendship. <br>
<br>
If life were to grant one “physical” attribute wish to each of us in life, I would have wished for immeasurable
retracting long arms attached to my four foot eleven and half inch body allowing me to reach out, and hug those who own
my heart no matter where they lived on earth. With tears streaming down my face, I would have reached for Kathleen and
cradled her in a swathing cloth and warm friendship loving arms. <br>
<br>
I would have taken advantage of this arm-extension wish granting moment seven years earlier allowing me to hug my
biological sister Shara, who delivered the same Cancer news in a phone call to me on a life changing Thursday. Her
Breast Cancer was slow in taking her home to heaven. No matter what type of Cancer your loved one is diagnosed with, it
is a life changing diagnosis for you as well. <br>
<br>
What you are left with when news of this magnitude is divulged is a flat lined code blue life altering moment.
Everything stops, and silence becomes the embracer. Just shy of a week since Kathleen called me with her Cancer
diagnosis I had been moving into my new home. Well it physically was not exactly a new home. It was an old, very old
mobile home, but it was new to me. I had decided a month prior to this devastating phone call to try life on my own once
again, outside of my 30- year marriage. <br> After looking around not only on the Internet, and on local real estate offices
for something I could purchase, I was told about an older mobile home that was being sold in a senior park in town.
After barely inspecting this home for flaws, I bought it. Had I taken more time to look for something newer, I would
never have had the most incredible year of my life. During this weeks Saturday phone call from Kathleen, I had promised
her I would be in Georgia before her first chemotherapy treatment. She was my best friend, and I belonged at her side. <br> I
knew this as well as I knew my own name. What I didn’t realize was that wrapped up in that promise, was a month long
terrifying existence once I got to the Georgia holler. Murder, death, coffins, urns, and tears all in one month. Life
was going to take a monumental change in me for eternity. Oh Lord, why test my faith when my life is dedicated to your
words. Why me? Why not me? <br>
<br>

At the end of November 2004, I was packing my bags for Georgia as well as unpacking my belongings into my new little
home. What happen in November 2004 was that I went from a two-bedroom one-bathroom mobile home in Montana to a two-
bedroom, one bath log cabin in Georgia. Neither location offered familiarity but both quickly offered a change in my
life that would alter my thinking forever. <br>
Sitting in the middle of this Georgia Holler cabin as I peruse this living room, the one thing I realize among any other
senses I have, is that death is surrounding me, and I want out of this room that is not living at all. It is a death
dwelling. It is cold, dirty, dusty, and void of everything Kathleen said it was. Her spirit was not in this cabin, only
her slowly dying body was. And me. Sister like friends for years, now Cancer demised. <br>
<br>
If the future were predictable, I would have lovingly sent flowers and cards of support from Montana. Hindsight however
is always twenty twenty. True friendship is always tested. I would like to think Kathleen asked me to be there because
she needed someone to witness her life, as Cancer slowly sucked it dry. I would also like to believe I went to Georgia
to render loving care to my best friend. What transpired in the month I was there allows me to question how far a
friendship boundary should extend. The answer to that question unfolds as this story is told. <br>
<br>
As I unpacked my boxes and bags in my newly acquired nineteen sixty-six single wide, ten by fifty mobile home, I
overlooked all of its flaws. I just wanted to be settled in so that I could leave as soon as possible for Kathleen’s
home in Georgia, as promised. It was clean, but smelled of cat urine. It had several broken windows and two doors that
did not shut out the cold of winters approach. It had mold, and mildew, broken drawers and a bathroom that was not fit
for human waste. But there I was, alone in my newly acquired home. I was determined to make this home refurbished into a
cozy Montana haven where my life would be reborn. Freedom from my marriage rendered me totally broke. That was my
option. Stay and be taken care of in a prison-like manner, or freedom without funding for life. I chose life, and nearly
homelessness with exhilaration. <i>When life itself brings you it’s storms, you then with the grace of God learn to dance
in the rain.</i>  <br>
<br>
A gentleman friend whom I had met years prior through an international foundation that I was Founder of, had lent me the
twenty –five hundred dollars to pay for this home. You see, I have never met him in person either. Almost all of my
friendships these last ten years have been created via the Internet and the PRYS Foundation. His name is Mike Waller, of
Ohio. Mike knew at the time I really wanted to try life on my own, but without any funds to my name because my husband
said my freedom would cost me my lifestyle, he sent me the money I needed. His helping hand allowed this chance of
freedom in my life to be granted. I was finally free of a marriage that hadn’t allowed touching or holding, intimacy, or
passion. It was rules, and rules, yes sir, no sir, all the time. It was a prison, and I was desperately lonely. I was a
nun without a habit. <br>
Who could have ever imagined I was on a conveyor belt in my life that had no switch to turn off. The storms life was
about to descend on my life meant my dancing shoes would be worn out in one month’s time. Little did I know then that
multiple shoes would be needed if I were going to survive my eminent future. <br>
<br>
Opening drawers in my home and cleaning them out did not take that long. I had only brought over a few carloads of
things to begin my new life. In the kitchen, most of the drawers were made of wood, and closed at an angle unless you
struggled with them to line up correctly. Most of them did return to their original positions in time if you grunted,
pushed, swore, and promised to be a good as long as they would close just this once. That promise worked a few times,
but grunting and pushing usually seemed to correct the crooked drawers. <br>
<br>
Amongst the bags, and boxes were suitcases strewed with clothing dangling out of the open lid. I had never been to
Georgia in the winter so I decided to take jeans and sweaters as well as a few pair of shorts. By the time I was ready
to close my suitcase I was having as much trouble with the zipper doing its magic, as the kitchen drawers doing theirs.
I can remember taking a huge breathe in and holding it. I was hoping that the cliché counting to ten while holding your
breath would work some type of miracle with my stress and anxiety level. It really does not take a college graduate with
a diploma to realize some clichés are nothing but empty advice filled with hot air. <br>
<br>
My reservations were made for a flight that flew out of Montana in five days. It would not however get me to Georgia
before Kathleen’s first Chemotherapy treatment, but it did give me time to close up my world here for as long as I
needed to be gone. I had promised Kathleen I would stay with her through winter if she really felt she needed my help. I
cannot say no to a friend in need. My heart will not let me. My word is and will always be my bond. The eyes of the Lord
watch over my walk. It has to be straight. <br>
<br>
One fleeting thought crossed my mind though as I continued to unpack, and packed, how I was going to get to Kathleen
once I arrived in Georgia. Heck I was not even sure how far it was to her home from the airport. I never seemed to have
asked the important questions. I always gave her the quickest answer from my heart. “Sure I will come and stay for as
long as you need me,” I said. Then I would blurt out almost instantly in the same breath, “Don’t you worry hunny, I will
be there as soon as possible!” The thought of logistics on the how and when’s in life never cross my mind. I figure that
if Moses could cross a desert, asking me to get from point A to point B has to be a whiz. I realized at that moment
also, I did not have a staff or Sheppard, and I was not Moses! I could feel my eyes roll up in my head, and knew again I
had gotten myself into a situation that was begging for a miracle. <br>
<br>
I decided to turn on my computer and search Georgia Taxi Services, Greyhound Bus Services on Ask.com. I would ultimately
go and visit distance amounts and directions from the airport in Atlanta to Young Harris, Georgia via Expedia after Ask.com. I went to Ask.com and typed in a very
simple question. How do I get from the Atlanta
International Airport to Kathleen’s house? I suppose if the little tuxedo dressed icon that Ask.com has as their mascot
could have rolled his eyes at the wording of my question, he would have. <br>
<br>
So I revised my question to how many miles from Atlanta International Airport to Young Harris, Georgia. VOILA! The
little tuxedo dressed mascot from Ask.com sent me right to the Expedia website on the Internet. Of course, that was my
second choice! I just smiled, and realized that little tuxedo man did not know Kathleen, and did not know about Young
Harris, Georgia either. While at Expedia.com I typed in the information, I needed. <br> Well it turns out that Kathleen’s
home is about two and a half hours from Atlanta. So much for a taxicab taking me that distance I thought. Moving on to
the next website I also decided to find chat rooms on the Internet that were located in Georgia. <br>
<br>
I posted a question to the room, “Is there anyone in Georgia near the airport that could tell me the best way to get to
Young Harris? I am desperately looking for information prior to my arrival there.” A gentleman responded shortly there
after and said he has information that might be of help. He privately messaged me and introduced himself. He further
explained he was the owner of a transport company, and has trucks that frequent the miles from the airport to Young
Harris. While we conversed and he understood why I was coming to Georgia, he made a generous offer. <br> He would pick me up
at the airport, and personally drive me to the hospital where Kathleen had been admitted. Knowing this was a perfect
stranger, I gathered his information, and verified it with the company. Indeed this was the owner/president of this
twenty-year- old company. I emailed this man back, and accepted his generous offer. <br>
<br>

After closing up my home, and making sure it was winterized, I headed to the airport. Without hesitation, I was on my
way to Kathleen. I hated to fly, I hated to leave my newly acquired little home, I hated the thought of not being with
my kids for the holidays. I also hated the idea of knowing I was on my way to be with Kathleen, my best friend, and sit
by while she slowly dies. I had done this with my sister, and the awareness of knowing how precious these hours and
minutes can bring us both were moments I certainly did not want to miss. <br>
<br>
I arrived at the airport in Atlanta, Georgia on time. Standing with a small sign with my name on it was Al, the owner of
the transport company. He was a tall, very fit, well-dressed man, with warm caring eyes. His smile could have lit up an
entire runway had he been given that chance. He extended his arms and gave me a hug, as though he had known me for
years. He whispered softly, “Welcome to Georgia.” He gently guided me to the baggage area, and then to his car. On the
seat of the car was a yellow rose. He asked me to give Kathleen this rose and told me to share with her his best wishes.
I immediately could feel tears flooding my eyes. It truly was the first time I stopped to realize that I was on a journey to say goodbye to a friendship, while making a new one in that instant. How strange are
the turns ones life can take when we are least expecting it. <br>
<br>
Al drove the next two and a half hours questioning my work in the foundation. We covered an array of subjects, Kathleen
being the prominent topic. Al was separated from his wife of 32 years. He attributed their discord to his wife’s
perception that his transport business was his marriage, and she was his job. With so many children, and grandchildren
to talk about, Al had many stories to keep the miles to Kathleen dropping steadily. <br>
There were very few moments on this drive that were silent. It was as though God had put the right man in the drivers’
seat for me. Although Al and I were strangers, I had an uncanny faith in this man to deliver me to my destination
without any fear at all. I knew that the Lord created this miracle arrival of Al. You did not question this situation,
but lived with acceptance of it, in peace, for whatever humanly reasons you wanted to attach to it. <br>
<br>
Once we arrived at the hospital parking lot, Al rushed to open my door, remove my suitcase out of the trunk and show me
to the information booth at the hospital lobby. There Al hugged me good-bye, and said he would keep both Kathleen and me
in prayer. He also left me with one thought; “If the Lord asks for Kathleen to come home, do so knowing you are only
saying good-bye until he calls your own name.” I never again heard from Al. As quickly as he entered my life, he was
also gone from it. I watched Al get in his car, and quietly thanked the Lord for his angel that got me to Kathleen safely. <br>
<br>
Entering Kathleen’s hospital room my eyes lay cemented on this sleeping woman I have called friend for so many years.
She looked peaceful, with a paleness of exhaustion. Tubes and IV’s were abundant, as was the beeping sounds hospitals
are known for. In the background, you could hear hospital pages of nurses, doctors, and more. Instinctively I reached
for the backside of the door, and closed it. It was as though I was closing out the world, and creating a new one. I had
in my hand the yellow rose Al had given me. I placed it in a vase that was already at Kathleen’s bedside. <br>
<br>
Sitting down quietly, ensuring the chair did not rub the floor like most hospital chairs do. The minutes passed so
quickly. A small grunting sound filled the room and I jumped out of the corner chair, and leaned over Kathleen. I took
her hand, and smiled and said “hi darlin.” Kathleen smiled and sat up, shoving the two pillows into her lower back.
There was the familiar sounding voice, lisping words, and gentle touch of her hand to mine. We were by some oddly gifted
destiny webbed into a friendship so unlikely and different as night and day. <br>Kathleen was free spirited, carefree,
unencumbered by life’s expectations, and I was the practical, society following, human replica of how you are suppose to
be in the “norm” of womanhood. Laughing at the differences we have, as we compared them again for the first hour of that day kept us from crying our eyes out like the
floodgates we knew we were both holding at bay. <br>
<br>
Kathleen scolded me but good when I told her about the history of the yellow rose. She smelled it, and smiled, and shook
her head at me repeatedly. She said, “Sparkie, if I could find me a switch at this moment, I would tan your behind for
that stunt.” I remember thinking I wish she had the strength to follow through on her threat. It was so obvious the
chemo she had two days prior was gripping her energy, as well as her life. Kathleen lay there bobbing her head side to
side and back and forth. I reached for the doubled up pillows and gently lay her back to sleep again. <br>
During the next two days, I had met Kathleen’s caregivers that also lived on her property. Over the years that I known
Kathleen she had told me stories of this couple that lived on her property, and some of the disagreements she had had
with them. She also told me stories of good times as well. This couple would share meals with Kathleen, drive her to
doctor appointments, and care for the menagerie of animals Kathleen called “her kids.” I had not formed an opinion of
this couple by any of the accounts Kathleen had shared until a month prior when Kathleen told me some of the situations
she had endured with them. <br>
<br>
Kathleen explained that her walker had been missing for months. She also explained many accountings of verbal challenges
while having visits to the banks where Kathleen kept her accounts. There were issues that Kathleen worried about, but
she never went into detail with me about them. She just would say she wished I were there to help her sort through all
of the decisions that were made on a particular day. I did not question her further about these concerns. Most of these
conversations seemed like venting episodes, and the intensity in Kathleen’s voices eased once she shared some of the
frustrations. I guess I should have questioned her more in depth, but I did not want to pry. From what I gathered in
some of these situations, heated conversations about vehicles and horse equipment were at the center of the disputes. <br>
<br>
Kathleen loved to order things for friends. She would order gifts of love for her animals as well. When it came time for
medical equipment for her, she always had to go through an uncle who was executor of a trust fund her parents set up. It
stipulated from what I had been able to understand that it was not for trips, or fancy cars, but a trust fund for
practical things. Kathleen would share with me medical items she had purchased, but always hated to have to explain to
her uncle why she needed the item. She said it felt like begging and having to prove to him that her disability was in
fact real, and not some trumped up situation. <br>
<br>
She often spoke of this uncle as living in the dark ages, and not understanding her PPS illness, or her other health
concerns. She could call him several times before he would return her calls. Then she would explain how she had to give
him a detailed accounting of the doctors she was seeing, the reason for seeing them, and the outcome of the visits. She
always said that he was like a shoelace on a pair of shrunken sneakers. Tighter than a knot and always coming untied when asking for anything to ease her living situation. Getting anything medical
from him she said was like having to prove she would die without the item. It got to the point where Kathleen would ask
me if it was wrong to ask him to buy her another walker since she could not find her old one. She had not a clue what
happen to it, since it was part of her daily existence. It would not be until later that I discovered her walker, and
where. <br>
<br>
I suppose at the time I assumed if they were her caregivers as she referred to them as, and at times used the word
friends, she trusted them to do things in her best interest. I was never so wrong about anything. This is an assumption
I will never again take for granted. These people give caregivers have a completely new meaning. Criminals come to mind
along with that saying devil in sheep’s clothing. Maybe one day the FBI will look into their accountability. That is
where man’s justice will be, Gods will be at his gates. The way I see it now, Gods wrath will take place before the FBI
will have any interest in this real life accounting. <br>
<br>
Five days have passed since my arrival. I have formed a semi-topical bond with Kathleen’s caregivers. Kathleen not only
has chemo tearing up her guts, but she is spilling her guts to me in an hour-by-hour confession of her life with these
people that she has referred to as caregivers. If ones ears could curl, my ears would be shut closed, and laminated in
this position from what they are hearing. Kathleen’s heart wrenching accounting of beatings by these people, starving
days, missing medical equipment, and being held captive in her own home were just the surface confessions told to me.
Kathleen spoke of bouts of their yelling at her to shut up. She knew they had been stealing things from her, but she was
sure of the magnitude. <br>
<br>
Repeatedly, Kathleen recounted items she remembered purchasing, and items missing. She did however concede that it would
be lonely without anyone there to care for her. These people fed her multitude of dogs. Many of them were Siberian
Huskies. She had horses, and cats, dogs. Over the years, many of the dogs had litters. We would talk about finding them
homes. She became emotional in explaining how she always had to keep one or two for herself. That is how her abundance
of animals continually grew. <br>
<br>
We talked about her concern of the extended animal family would be cared for if she did not survive the chemotherapy.
The dogs had kennels, and her property was well equipped with electric fencing. During the many conversations, Kathleen
and I had prior to my arrival, and Kathleen getting Cancer, we talked about all the remodeling that her small cabin
needed. From what I could gather on the phone, her floors were uneven planks of wood. It sounded also that some of these
planks of wood had gapping holes in them, or rotted out areas that Kathleen would trip and often fall because of them.
She wanted a porch off her tiny cabin home in order to keep her favorite dogs during in climate weather, dry and warm.
Her kitchen was another area she was having issues with, and wanted to replace. It seemed as though these areas were
always brought up in conversations over the years, without much progress. What had made significant progress was the amount of money Kathleen was spending on paying her caregivers. I often wondered, but never
asked if they were blackmailing her. In the last year of Kathleen’s life, her urgency for me to come for a visit was
more emphatic in our Saturday conversations than I can recount in other years. There was a begging type consistency in
her request. <br>
<br>
When I would question Kathleen about her remodeling projects, and who her contractor was, she would say that George, or
Sandi, her caregivers, were going to do the remodel for her. Sometimes it was months and months of talking about them
doing these projects for her, but I can only remember one being completed. George and Sandi’s new home, on Kathleen’s
property. Kathleen was paying for this home, in many ways. Her caregivers were not caring for her as well as they were
caring for the multiple dogs on the property. They threw tidbits of kindness towards Kathleen, but then would get into
huge verbal confrontations that I heard during many of our Saturday morning calls. <br>
<br>
Kathleen went into detail about how hard George would work on their new home, and how lazy Sandy was. She explained away
the amount of time for them in getting to her own projects, was the fact that Sandy was a drinker. George was by all
accounts closer to Kathleen than Sandi, his wife. <br>
<br>
The moment the hospital door would open to her room, Kathleen would shut her mouth, open her eyes and force a smile to
her caregiver. We totally would change topics, and the mood in the room. I was getting good at this switching up
emotional roller coaster I had been plummeted into. It was heartache in one moment, smiling into oblivion the next. <br>
<br>
The more I learned about these people, the harder it was to put on the façade that I was indebted to them on any level
for Kathleen’s care. There were a couple times when Kathleen shared with me the level of beatings she endured, having to
swallow my own vomit. The vile taste in my mouth was not nearly as revolting as the phony smile her caregiver would
display, as she would saunter into Kathleen’s hospital room. <br>
<br>
I lost count the times Sandy would start her conversations with, “Now Kathleen, remember hunny, we don’t share
everything with everyone. You can tell Sparkie about the dogs, and how special they are, right?” It was as though over
the years as caregivers, Sandy and George had programmed Kathleen to adhere to their rules, rather than the other way
around. It was time to take Kathleen home. Home to die with dignity. <br>
<br>
As my eyes perused this living room in Georgia my desperate attempt to put some type of holiday cheer around Kathleen’s
deathbed was almost futile. I had found some scotch tape and hung up holiday cards that arrived in her mailbox. Some of
the cards were from doctors, and bankers as well as local car dealerships she must have done business with. Several attempts had been made to keep the cards hanging on the glass windows. The filth of dog feces,
and passed cat sprays, dust, spider webs and more prevented my earlier attempts to have these cards adhere securely.
Washing the windows was not so much of a problem as was removing the years and years of build up on the windows to find
a place, the tape would hold. With the dirt, cigarette build up, cat and dog hairs everywhere, the miracle of Christmas
was in competition with the Scotch Magic tape in keeping up the holiday cards. <br>
<br>
Like that of dripping icicles onto a window, so was the feces, and other animal by products that had to be scraped off
before any kind of Christmas cheer would stick. One trickle after another of darkened clumps slowly slid down from the
walls onto the glass and from the glass to the wall below the window, and finally resting on the floor. <br>
<br>
In the corner of this room was a bookshelf that Kathleen obviously had decorated for the holidays before she was given
the crushing Cancer news. Packages of all sizes, wrapping of all colors, and bows made of different style loops were
hiding these Christmas wrapped gifts of love. I had not even walked over to any of the packages fearing my gourmet hot
chocolate package that was a yearly gift from Kathleen, would be amongst the non-mailed pile. <br>
<br>
Upon further inspecting this room after days of being in this cabin, was a propane style fireplace that I hadn’t noticed
before. There on the mantel sat two golden urns. Beside that on the floor, was the dead babies’ boxed casket. A few feet
beside that was Kathleen. I was no more than three feet from any of them. Just sitting, staring, almost more paralyzed
than those who experienced the Poliovirus. I had been cleaning for days, hours upon hours fighting desperately to get
back that smell we all associate with cleanliness. It just wasn’t happening as quickly as I wanted it to. Under the sink
in the kitchen were bottles of cleaning supplies. Lathered and caked on the tops were cobwebs, filth, and unopened cap
wrappings. Obviously they were well intentioned in their purchase, but vacant of anyone using them. <br>
<br>
There were wooden shelving around this cabin that had lost their luster and replaced with spiders, dead flies,
mosquitoes and moths. Hundreds of moth carcasses of various types were scatters on the floors, shelves, and entangled in
what looked like curtains. Most of what covered the windows were fit for being dust rags. All of them lay heavily upon
their rods, full of filth, and debris. Time passed so slowly every day. Kathleen laying there, slowly breathing, and
never making more than grunting sounds, and moans. Once in a while you would her take a cleansing breath, but that was
getting more rare with each day. <br>
<br>
Outside you could hear the dog barking, growling, and tossing their metal water dishes about the yard. More often now,
had I heard the dogs free of their kennels and running about the front of this cabin. You were able to hear them
sniffing at the crack in the door space just above the floor. The outside was clearly seen through this crack, and the dogs would paw at the door whenever I began to cook anything. Heavily scratching and barking were almost the norm
these days. I often wondered if they were making this much chaos to get into the cabin to see Kathleen, or to attack me. <br>
I wasn’t brave enough to find out. Every fiber in my body shook when the dogs were circling the cabin. Each dog was big,
although individually they didn’t appear to be vicious. Collectively as they packed around the front of the cabin, their
demeanor was projecting an animal instinct that had wildness to it. Perhaps it was the wolf breeding in them that
projected this pack like behavior. After observing them through the window, it was easy to see why Kathleen loved these
dogs, and the security they must have given her. They were her passion, and owned her heart. <br>
<br>
Pausing briefly to take inventory of how much cleaning was still to do, tears streamed down my cheeks, and my lips began
to quiver. I allowed my eyes to peruse these walls slowly, adding up in my mind the enormity of the cleaning job ahead
of me that still remained. I can remember thinking as I gazed down at Kathleen just lying so still, why couldn’t I have
come sooner? I stretched out my hand, and rested it gently on Kathleen’s. Bending over her hospital bed railings, my
head collapsed onto her extremely distended tummy. <br> Tears were just streaming without thought, and sobs were being
birthed from the depths of my being. I wanted the pain to stop as much as I wanted the fear to disappear. I was crying
for us both. Goosebumps were abundant throughout my entire body, and my knees were shaking, barley holding my body in
place. Sobbing out loud and craving for any signs of life from my dear friend would have made everything worth all this
exhausting emotion. Oh God, I was missing her so much, and she was still right here. I can’t explain the vastness of
this pain in my heart knowing soon I would never have this skin-to-skin touch with her again. Soon she would be in
heaven, and buried with her family. Consciously aware that in the passing of Kathleen’s life, there was a death
event-taking place of my own. <br> My naiveté days were obliterated in the reality of my present existence. I could no longer
walk through life believing everything would be joyous if you loved enough, worked hard enough, and were kind enough to
every soul that crossed your path. I was having a hard time finding goodness in George and Sandy. <br>
<br>
I am searching for the beauty in the season while being forced to witness the ugliness of greedy human hearts. Trying to
monetarily put some kind of value of life’s worthiness left me penniless when you are walking the path of Cancer. It
robs your heart, it steals your laughter, it bestows you a vastness of tears, it crunches your heart, and it voids your
tranquility in each day. Most of all it rapes you from being able to hold, and hug, and converse with those you love. It
takes it all. After losing my sister Shara, and now in slowly induced increments of immeasurable pain, it is taking my
Kathleen away. With my faith in God and the chosen path I have for my own walk in life, I sit on this cabin floor among
the filth and wonder if this is really Christmas at its very meaning. To ache for a loved one, while celebrating their
life. <br>
<br> 
Come journey with me through these turning of pages of Kathleen’s life. Our friendship, and the bonds that are formed as
we extend our hands and hearts into another human beings world have the ability to change our destiny forever. Through
weeks of torment, filth, a murder, two urns, one baby filled coffin, packs of wolf blended dogs, electrified fences, the
FBI, the Georgia Police, Sandy and George, and of course Kathleen, your own life will be changed forever. The way you
define your word as your bond, and your commitment to friendship will be clarified sometimes by one simple phone call.
Christmas will never be the same for me. The Lord as blessed me with this clarity into the meaning of walking in this
life and the tribulations we define our earthly existence by. Change isn’t always easy; truth isn’t always easy, writing
this book isn’t always easy. What is easy is knowing within my own heart, I wouldn’t change a thing about my love of
Kathleen and our friendship bond we shared. In her memory my prayer is to honor her life, our love, and most of all, the
peace she now resides within.
