    <h2>How It Is</h2>
    <p>
        Tell me how it is so I can understand <br>
        Show me how it works so I can expand <br>
        Teach me slowly the ways of the world <br>
        Talk to me, when life throws me into a whirl <br>
        <br>
        
        Days and nights, clamoring into one pool <br>
        Making my life, useful, creative, and a valued tool <br>
        Guide me so I am able to share, what life has shown <br>
        Making me, stable, worldly, and mentally grown <br>
        <br>
        
        Growing up in days with so much emotional distress <br>
        Has made my mental images, confused and a mess <br>
        Hold my hand, when the light is no longer bright <br>
        Tell me again, how to make things for both of us right <br>
        <br>
        
        
        Give me directions, so that I can walk to you straight <br>
        Making me whole, and pure, for the white pearly gate <br>
        Strengthen me with convictions, of what purity means <br>
        Making me tougher and wiser, like an old pair of blue jeans <br>
        <br>
        
        Make life with me, gentle as we walk in the dark <br>
        Show me again, the beauty, that's hidden in some snow laden park <br>
        Smiles on my face, coping with life's hurried old pace <br>
        Loving you in the end, is how I'd wish to win this race <br>
        <br>
        
        Step by step, we can share the wisdom we have obtained <br>
        Making each of us whole and enlightened, once again <br>
        Lights shining brightly, as we gaze in one another eyes <br>
        Hearing the "I love you", as we hold one another in replies <br>
        <br>
        
        Taking my heart, as nature had intended us to do <br>
        Life is sharing the knowledge and love, as we always knew <br>
        Growing closer, and holding one in the grasp of love <br>
        How nicely we fit together, like a warm leather glove <br>
