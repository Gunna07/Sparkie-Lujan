        <h2>GROWING UP</h2>
        <p>
           
            I like being little but I dream of being grown up <br>
            From sucking on a bottle to holding an adult size cup <br>
            I hope the world is ready for my ideas and me <br>
            Because I am going to be an entrepreneur you see <br>
            <br>
            I am going to go to college and learn about life <br>
            No doubt about it, I want to be one day a loving wife <br>
            I am going to invent things to save the world <br>
            I will be known as the brilliant young girl <br>
            <br>
            I am going to invent hearts that feel compassion <br>
            I will design words for people to us in the right fashion <br>
            There are going to be warm hugs and sincere kissing <br>
            I want to show the world just what they've been missing <br>
            <br>
            My hope is one day is to create a war free earth <br>
            This creation will flourish in love with its expanding girth <br>
            To live in love and peace and total harmony <br>
            It's a prayer of mine, when I get on my knee <br>
            <br>
            No more scuffed shoes will reside on my feet <br>
            Because by now you know I am grown to almost six feet <br>
            My plans for a world to be free of pain and war <br>
            Isn't so far when you to dream and pray at Gods door <br>
            <br>
            And now that I am older and seventy years have now passed <br>
            The world isn't in peace, and its pain has still last <br>
            But my dreams as child will continue to guide me <br>
            So will my prayers for peace and love as I get down once again on my knee <br>
